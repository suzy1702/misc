This is my best attempt at computing SED to date. This computes SED for GaN or similar structure. It needs refining; I am still working on it.

Instead of using the typical 4 atom unit cell, I am using an 8 atoms cells with simple orhtorhombic lattice vectors. See the 'wurtzite.jpg' and 'reciprocal.jpg' images
for the definition of my unit cell, lattice vectors, and reciprocal lattice.
