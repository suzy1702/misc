This is a deprecated directory that previosly contained files used to write my code to make wurtzite structures.

The basis funtion for making wurtzite has been included in 'ty.py' in pyModule; my own custom python module. This function is bested suited for EMD simulations for e.g. SED.

Future codes for making wurtzite structures for e.g. NEMD purposes, with defects, interfaces, etc. may be written here.

As of now (01.04.2019) this directory only contains references.
