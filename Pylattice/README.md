# Pylattice
Pronounced 'pilates' like the exercise.

# What is it?
A simple code to construct and plot the real and reciprocal lattices given arbitrary lattice vectors. It also calls a Voronoi library from Scipy to compute the Brilloin zone of both lattices.

# Also
I might try to right my own code to compute the Voronoi diagrams as well. The paper for 'XcrySDen' gives some resources for this. "Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling Volume 17, Issues 3–4, June–August 1999, Pages 176-179"
