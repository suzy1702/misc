This is my first attemp at computing SED for a crytal with a basis. e.g. FCC-diamond Si with a 2 atoms basis. 

This code never worked quite right. I couldn't resolve optical modes and was missing some accoustic. I think I created a structure using a different
unit cell that my k-points correspond to (I got my k-points from brucefan1983's  MATLADY codes).

I abandoned this to work on GaN for which I have devised my own k points.
