All code written by Riley Hadjis (riha6265@colorado.edu)

Code in this folder is divided into two tools
1) phonon lifetime code
    Get phonon lifetimes from SED data for a given k-point
2) Band tracing
    Trace bands in SED or other surface data

Note that the band tracing code only pointBandTracing code is the only one that works. The other in that folder is an experimental band tracing by connecting the points. 

All dependencies are included in each folder. The matlab scripts are the top scripts in each folder.
